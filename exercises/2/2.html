    <h1>Level 2: Mad Libs</h1>
    <p>Using <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a>, set up a screen where you're viewing the HTML, JavaScript, and Output.</p>
    <p>You will need to create the following elements in your HTML:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A header</li>
      <li>An unordered list with 3 items. Each item should contain a label (noun, adjective, or someone's name) and a text box for the user to type in.</li>
      <li>A button</li>
      <li>An empty div with the id <code>story</code></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Create a new function with an event listener for the button on your page.</p>
    <p>In the function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.").</p>
