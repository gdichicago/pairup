    <h1>Level 2: Cat walk</h1>
    <p>The goal of this exercise to make an awesome interactive animated cat.</p>

    <p>Start with <a href="http://jsbin.com/farox/1/edit?html,js,output"><span class="symbol">j</span> this JSBin</a>. <strong>You can't edit that, you need to make a copy of it.</strong> Click Bins, then Clone to make a copy. If you change the original code, you might break it. You should only be <em>adding new code</em>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Add an event listener to the start button, so that the cat starts moving across the screen when its clicked.</li>
      <li>Add an event listener to the stop button, so that the cat stops moving when clicked.</li>
      <li>Add an event listener to the speed button, so that the cat moves faster when it's clicked.</li>
      <li><strong>Bonus</strong>: Disable the start/stop/faster buttons at the appropriate times (e.g. the user shouldn't be able to click "stop" if the cat isn't currently moving.)</li>
    </ul>
