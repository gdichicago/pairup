    <p>Using <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a>, set up a screen where you're viewing the JavaScript, Console, and Output.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Write a function called <code>squareNumber</code> that will take one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like <code>The result of squaring the number 3 is 9</code>.</li>
      <li>Write a function called <code>halfNumber</code> that will take one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should also log a string like <code>Half of  5 is 2.5</code>.</li>
      <li>Write a function called <code>percentOf</code> that will take two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should also log a string like <code>2 is 50% of 4</code>.</li>
      <li>Write a function called <code>areaOfCircle</code> that will take one argument (the radius), calculate the area based on that, and return the result. It should also log a string like <code>The area for a circle with radius 2 is 12.566370614359172</code>.
        <ul>
          <li>Bonus: Round the result so there are only two digits after the decimal.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Write a function that will take one argument (a number) and perform the following operations, using the functions you wrote earlier:
        <ol>
          <li>Take half of the number and store the result.</li>
          <li>Square the result of #1 and store that result.</li>
          <li>Calculate the area of a circle with the result of #2 as the radius.</li>
          <li>Calculate what percentage that area is of the squared result (#3).</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
