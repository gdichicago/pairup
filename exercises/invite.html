   <p>What's an upcoming event that you're organizing or that you're attending and want others to come to? Create a webpage for that event!
   </p>

   <ul>
    <li>Create a basic webpage with the event name, logistical information (in a table), and an embedded Google Map of where it is. 
    <li>Create a Google form and embed it on the page.
    <li>Come up with a color scheme, using Color Scheme Designer or ColourLovers, and apply that using CSS to parts of your page.
    <li>Find a Google Web Font that suits your event theme, and use that for the headers of your page.
   </ul>
