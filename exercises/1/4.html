    <h1>Level 1: Media queries</h1>
    <p>The goal of this exercise is to use CSS media queries to make a webpage appear different for printing and for different window sizes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a new page with some HTML and basic CSS. You'll need a header, navigation menu, content, sidebar, and a footer. Try and really get some content in there so you have lots of stuff to play with.</li>
      <li>Add a CSS media query and appropriate styles so the website adjusts for smaller screens. Start with one size - like a 13" laptop or an iPhone. Google to get the screen resolution in pixels.</li>
      <li>Some things to try: <ul>
        <li>Hide the header and footer.</li>
        <li>Change the way your navigation is displayed.</li>
        <li>Show your sidebar underneath your main content.</li>
        <li>Remove the excess padding from the body.</li>
        <li>Fix the header at the top of the page no matter how far down you scroll.</li>
        <li>Change the font size or font family.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Try adding in another media query for a different size.</li>
    </ul>
