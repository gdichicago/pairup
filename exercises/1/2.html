    <h1>Level 1: HTML Embedding</h1>
    <p>In this exercise, you'll add embedded elements to a new page. For some of these, you may have to Google to figure out how to get embed codes - some sites make it easier/more obvious than others.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Create a new blank page with just a header (“All About Dogs”).</li>
      <li>Take a look at the “NET” tab in Chrome Developer Tools and write down the loading stats on the page - number of requests, KB transferred, onload ms, DOMContentLoaded ms.</li>
      <li>Add an embedded Google Map that shows dog parks in Chicago.</li>
      <li>Add Facebook comments to your page.</li>
      <li>Add a Twitter button to the page.</li>
      <li>Create a Google custom search engine that searches across multiple dog sites and embed the search box on the page.</li>
      <li>For each of the embeds, add comments around them to </li>show where they start and end, and add an <code>h2</code> to split the page up into sections.</li>
      <li>Take a look at the “NET” tab again and write down the new stats on the page.</li>
    </ul>
